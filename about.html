            <p> Hi, Iâ€™m Michele. 
                For many years I have done several jobs, but I felt I had never found the right path.
                Then I got to know the digital world, in particular the world of web development. <br>
                I started to study alone with material available for free on the internet, and I became interested in this world. <br>
                When I discovered S2I (Start to Impact) <br> I realized that studying with them would be a breakthrough for me and in fact I started my path to becoming a full-stack web developer.
                I finally feel that I have found something that allows me to fully express my potential and I am ready to put myself in the game.</p>
